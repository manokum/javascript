1. Useful Javascript Array and Object Methods
a).filter()
Creates a new array based on whether the items of an array pass a certain condition
const studentsAge = [17, 16, 18, 19, 21, 17];
const ableToDrink = studentsAge.filter( age => age > 18 );
// ableToDrink will be equal to [19, 21]

b).map()
Creates a new array by manipulating the values in another array.
Great for data manipulation and it is often used in React because it is an immutable method.
const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5];
const dollars = numbers.map( number => '$' + number);
// dollars will be equal to ['$2', '$3', '$4', '$5']

c)reduce()
This often overlooked method uses an accumulator to reduce all items in an array to a single value. 
Great for calculating totals. The returned value can be of any type (i.e. object, array, string, integer).
const numbers = [5, 10, 15];
const total = numbers.reduce( (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
// total will be equal to 30
reduce() is advantageous in scenarios like flattening an array of arrays, grouping objects by a property 
and removing duplicate items in array. 

d).forEach()
Applies a function on each item in an array.
Log each array item to the console
const emotions = ['happy', 'sad', 'angry'];
emotions.forEach( emotion => console.log(emotion) ); // Will log the following:// 'happy'// 'sad'// 'angry'

2) Useful Javascript Object Methods
a)Object.values()
  Return an array of the values of an object.
  const icecreamColors = {
    chocolate: 'brown',
    vanilla: 'white',
    strawberry: 'red',
  }
  const colors = Object.values(icecreamColors);
  // colors will be equal to ["brown", "white", "red"]

b)Object.keys()
  Return an array of the keys of an object.
  const icecreamColors = {
  chocolate: 'brown',
  vanilla: 'white',
  strawberry: 'red',
}

const types = Object.keys(icecreamColors);
// types will be equal to ["chocolate", "vanilla", "strawberry"]


Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc.

You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).
